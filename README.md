Email Delivery Note

Email delivery may be delayed by 2–5 minutes when using free hosting services due to server cold starts.

Free SMTP providers (e.g., Gmail) may queue or scan emails, causing additional delay.

For instant email delivery, it is recommended to use a transactional email service like SendGrid / Resend / Brevo in production.
